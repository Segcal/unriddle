            What's the difference between Unriddle and ChatGPT?

        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
          <Typography>
            On Unriddle you control the inputs. We designed the system to work
            with your own data sources, answering questions based only on the
            information you provide. This ensures highly accurate and relevant
            answers. ChatGPT is trained on a general pool of information found
            across the internet. It’s excellent at covering a wide range of
            topics but can struggle when the conversation becomes more focused
            and specific.
